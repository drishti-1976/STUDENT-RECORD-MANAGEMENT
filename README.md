# STUDENT-RECORD-MANAGEMENT

## overview
This program is a student record management system that allows users to enter, display, delete, update, and search student records. Let's break down its components and functionality:

1. Data Storage:
Student records are stored in five arrays: arr1 for names, arr2 for roll numbers, arr3 for classes, arr4 for courses, and arr5 for contact information.
The total variable keeps track of the total number of student records.

2. Functionality:
Enter Records: Allows the user to enter information for multiple students. If records already exist, it appends new records to the existing data.
Show Records: Displays all entered student records.
Delete Records: Offers options to delete a particular record based on the roll number or delete all records.
Update Records: Enables updating information for a student record based on the roll number.
Search Records: Searches for a specific student record based on the roll number.
Exit: Terminates the program.

3. User Interface:
The main menu prompts the user to choose an action.
After performing an action, the user is provided with options to return to the main menu or exit the application.
The program uses system("cls") to clear the screen for better readability.

## Note:
The program uses an infinite loop to keep the menu running until the user chooses to exit.
Each function includes its own user interface and flow control, offering a modular design.
Error handling for invalid input is minimal. Users are prompted to enter a valid choice if an invalid option is selected.
The program relies on arrays for storage, which may not be scalable for large datasets. Consider using dynamic data structures like vectors for more efficient memory management.

## Overall 
this program provides basic functionality for managing student records
